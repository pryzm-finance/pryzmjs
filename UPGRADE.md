# PrismJs Upgrade

## Generate TS files

1. Typescript files are generated using ignite-cli. Generated TS files will be located under `ts-client` directory. 
    
    For prism-core:
    
    ```bash
    cd prism-core
    ignite generate ts-client
    ```
    
    For prisma:
    
    ```bash
    cd prisma
    ignite generate ts-client
    ```
    
2. Move all generated files into prismjs source directory.
    
    ```bash
    cd prismjs
    rm -rf src
    mv ../prism-core/ts-client ./src
    mv ../prisma/ts-client/prismfinance.prisma.tics ./src/
    ```
    
3. Now in `src` directory, search for:
    
    ```tsx
    if (_m0.util.Long !== Long) {
    ```
    
    and replace with the following:
    
    ```tsx
    // @ts-ignore
    if (_m0.util.Long !== Long) {
    ```
    
4. In `src/client.ts`, search for:
    
    ```tsx
    AugmentedClient as typeof AugmentedClient
    ```
    
    and replace with the following:
    
    ```tsx
    AugmentedClient as typeof IgniteClient
    ```
    
5. In `src/prismfinance.prisma.tics/module.ts`, search for:
    
    ```tsx
    PrismfinancePrismaTics: new SDKModule(test)
    ```
    
    and replace with the following:
    
    ```tsx
    PrismfinancePrismatics: new SDKModule(test)
    ```
    
6. Then patch the following to the `src` directory.
    
    ```json
    cp ./patch/wsclient.ts ./src/
    cat ./patch/index-patch.ts >> src/index.ts
    ```
    
7. `prismjs/package.json` should be adapted to the generated `package.json` which is now under `prismjs/src/package.json`. This operation should always be done manually.  
    
    **Suggestion:**
    Move `prismjs/src/package.json` to `prismjs/package.json` and adapt the content to reflect the following:
    
    ```json
    {
      "name": "@prism-finance/prismjs",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "description": "Javascript SDK for Prism",

        }
      ],
      "main": "lib/index.js",

      "files": [
        "lib/**/*"

        "@types/node": "^18.11.9",
        "ts-node": "^10.9.1",
        "typescript": "^4.9.3"
      }
    }
    ```
    

## Install

```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install --shamefully-hoist
```

## Build

```bash
npm build
# or
pnpm build
```

## Publish

```bash

npm publish

**Attention:** 
You cannot publish prismjs with the same version twice. Consider removing the previously published package from [registry](https://github.com/prism-finance/prismjs/pkgs/npm/prismjs/versions).

**Attention:** 
After publishing a new version, open package settings and check the optionÂ ***Inherit access from source repository*** to grant access to all repository members.
